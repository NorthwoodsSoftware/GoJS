  <p>
    This sample demonstrates a custom <a>TreeLayout</a>, ParallelLayout,
    which assumes that there is a single "Split" node that is the root of a tree,
    other than links that connect with a single "Merge" node.
    The layout is defined in its own file, as <a href="ParallelLayout.js">ParallelLayout.js</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both the <a>Diagram.layout</a> and the <a>Group.layout</a> are instances of ParallelLayout,
    allowing for nested layouts that appear in parallel.
