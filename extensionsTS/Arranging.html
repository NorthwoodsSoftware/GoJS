  <p>
    This sample demonstrates a custom Layout, <a>ArrangingLayout</a>, that provides layouts of layouts.
    It assumes the graph should be split up and laid out by potentially three separate Layouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first step of ArrangingLayout is that all unconnected nodes are separated out to be laid out later by
    the <a>ArrangingLayout.sideLayout</a>, which by default is a <a>GridLayout</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remaining nodes and links are partitioned into separate subgraphs with no links between subgraphs.
    The <a>ArrangingLayout.primaryLayout</a> is performed on each subgraph.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is more than one subgraph, those subgraphs are treated as if they were individual nodes and are
    laid out by the <a>ArrangingLayout.arrangingLayout</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally the unconnected nodes are laid out by <a>ArrangingLayout.sideLayout</a> and they are all positioned
    at the <a>ArrangingLayout.side</a> Spot relative to the main body of nodes and links.
  </p>
  <p>
    This extension layout is defined in its own file, as <a href="ArrangingLayout.js">ArrangingLayout.js</a>.
