    <p>
      This sample demonstrates a custom <a>TreeLayout</a>, ParallelLayout,
      which assumes that there is a single "Split" node that is the root of a tree,
      other than links that connect with a single "Merge" node.
      The layout is defined in its own file, as <a href="ParallelLayout.ts">ParallelLayout.ts</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the <a>Diagram.layout</a> and the <a>Group.layout</a> are instances of ParallelLayout,
      allowing for nested layouts that appear in parallel.
    </p>
