  <p>This sample constructs an <a>HTMLInfo</a> that acts as a re-implementation of the default text editor.
  <p>The implementation is contained in the file <a href="TextEditor.ts" target="_blank">TextEditor.js</a>
    and exposes <code>window.TextEditor</code>,
    which is used in this file as the value of <code>myDiagram.toolManager.textEditingTool.defaultTextEditor</code>.
  <p>This also adds a text validation predicate, <code>okName</code>, as the <a>TextBlock.textValidation</a> property.
    That predicate makes sure that the new string has at least three characters and contains a vowel.
  <p>You can see additional custom text editors in the <a href="../samples/customTextEditingTool.html">Custom TextEditingTool sample</a>.
