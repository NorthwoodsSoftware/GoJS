<h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>
  If you have downloaded a copy of the <b>GoJS</b> library from <a href="https://gojs.net">gojs.net</a>
  for use in your own app, you have probably noticed that a watermark appears in the diagram.
  For version 1.7 and beyond, you need to use a license key to remove this watermark from your domain.
  For version 1.6 and older, you need to get a generated <code>go.js</code> or <code>go-debug.js</code> library that is tied to your particular domain.
</p>
<p>
  When you want to deploy to your own web site your app that uses <b>GoJS</b>, you will need to make a request at:
  <a href="https://www.nwoods.com/app/activate.aspx?sku=gojs" target="_blank">https://www.nwoods.com/app/activate.aspx?sku=gojs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Enter your e-mail address and the e-mail address of the person who purchased a license for <b>GoJS</b>,
  the order number for that purchase, and your web site's domain name.
  Please make sure that e-mail from "nwoods.com" is not caught in your corporate or personal spam filter.
  If you <a href="https://www.nwoods.com/contact.html">contact us</a> for further help either via our web site
  or by sending us email, please include the e-mail that our web server sent to you.
</p>
<p>
  Regarding domain names, for example, if your app will be at:
  <code>https://www.example.com/app/ProcessEditor.html</code>,
  enter <code>example.com</code> as the domain name.
  This procedure works for internal corporate web sites as well as for public web sites, with hostnames and with IP addresses.
  The protocol and port number do not matter.
  It will work when the HTML page is served from a subdomain of the licensed domain,
  such as from <code>editors.example.com</code>.
  It will also work when "localhost" is the domain, to help your debugging and testing efforts.
</p>
<p>
  The GoJS library never "phones home" -- it will never initiate any network traffic other than when explicitly directed to do so,
  such as for downloading image files.
</p>

<h2 id="For1.7AndLater">For 1.7 and Later</h2>
<p>
  Our server will generate a GoJS license key for you, in the form of a JavaScript statement that you will need to include with your code.
  It must execute after the GoJS library file has been loaded, but before you create your first <a>Diagram</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>// Must execute after loading the library and before you create your first Diagram:
go.licenseKey = "YourKeyHere";
</code></pre>
<p>
In TypeScript you may need to say:
</p>
<pre><code>// Must execute after loading the library and before you create your first Diagram:
(go as any).licenseKey = "YourKeyHere";
</code></pre>
<p>
  This mechanism works when using either the release library, <code>go.js</code>, or the debug library,
  <code>go-debug.js</code>, but only with GoJS version 1.7 or later.
  Of course you will need to substitute your generated license key string for <code>"YourKeyHere"</code> in the <code>go.licenseKey</code> assignment statement.
  License keys are long strings without any embedded whitespace or punctuation.
  You can request license keys for as many domains as you have licensed.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the older activation method, you no longer need to get a new domain-specific <code>go.js</code> library each time you update or upgrade.
  Once your key is in place, you can continue to use the same key while updating the patch version of GoJS.
  For example, a license key for version 1.7.3 will work for all versions 1.7.*.
  Remember to get a new license key when upgrading to a new major or minor version of GoJS.
  For example, when upgrading from version 5.3.1 to version 5.4.6, you will need a new license key.
</p>
<p>
  License keys only depend on the major/minor version number and the domain from which the HTML page was served.
  License keys are valid forever, as long as the major and minor version number of the library do not change and
  as long as the HTML page is served from the same domain.
</p>
<p>
  You can download the <code>go.js</code> library from the <a href="../doc/download.html" target="_blank">GoJS Downloads page</a>,
  or you can install it via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gojs" target="_blank">Node package manager (npm)</a>
  or via <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Northwoods.GoJS/" target="_blank">NuGet</a>,
  or you can link to a <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gojs" target="_blank">CDN</a>.
  Most customers will no longer need a special build of GoJS, as had been the case before version 1.7.
</p>

<h2 id="ForUnlimitedDomainsOEMCustomers">For Unlimited Domains OEM Customers</h2>
<p>
  If you are an ISV and intend to distribute your app to run on many customers' web sites,
  <a href="https://www.nwoods.com/contact.html">Contact sales</a> for our our Unlimited Domains option and
  instructions on requesting and using a custom <code>go.js</code> library that works on any site or platform.
</p>
<p>
  When building a desktop application using Electron or Cordova or NW or when hosted in a WebView as part of a desktop application,
  your HTML page is not being served from a web server at a domain.
  In such circumstances you will need to use the Unlimited Domains option to make sure your Diagram does not display a watermark.
</p>
<p>
  For version 1.8 and later, the instructions for Unlimited Domains customers have changed.
  The instructions, as before, will be emailed to you.
</p>

<h2 id="For1.6AndOlder">For 1.6 and Older</h2>
<p>
  Our automated web server will create <code>go.js</code> and <code>go-debug.js</code> libraries that are customized
  not to show a watermark on pages from that domain and will e-mail you instructions for how to download them.
</p>
<p>
  You can request libraries for as many domains as you have licensed.
  If there is a problem you will receive e-mail from our web server describing the problem.
</p>
<p>
  When updating or upgrading to a new version of <b>GoJS</b> less than version 1.7,
  you will need to get a new domain-specific <code>go.js</code> library again using the same procedure.
  (We too had to produce one for the domain "gojs.net" each time we updated our web site.)
</p>

<!--
<p>
  If you are building a Windows Store JavaScript app, there is no domain name.
  Instead you should use the application-specific "appId", a GUID.
  To obtain the proper ID your app must first be <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh454036.aspx">packaged with the windows app store</a>,
  so that the package name is the one to be used in production.
  Once you have associated your app with the windows store,
  you can find this GUID in your <code>package.appxmanifest</code> file as the <code>&lt;Package&gt;</code> <code>&lt;Identity&gt;</code> <code>Name</code> attribute.
</p>

<h2 id="InternationalizationAndLocalization">Internationalization and Localization</h2>
<p>
  <b>GoJS</b> apps can display text in non-Latin languages.
  For example, see <a href="../samples/familyTreeJP.html" target="samples">Japanese Family Tree</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>GoJS</b> library does not manipulate currency values or date/time values or addresses,
  so there are no localization issues with those data types and values.
  <b>GoJS</b> does not contain any of its own icons (images) or cursors.
</p>
<p>
  Nor does <b>GoJS</b> display any built-in text strings, so no translation is needed.
  There are error and warning messages that may be output to the console, but
  those messages are only meant for debugging by programmers, not for consumption by end users.
  Reading and writing of numeric values is only performed internally
  when reading and writing JSON or geometry path strings or CSS colors, which are all defined to use non-localized formats.
</p>
<p>
  All user-visible text is completely under the control of the programmer.
  For localizability you may find it convenient to use conversion functions in <a>Binding</a>s.
  The <a>TextEditingTool</a> uses an HTML TextArea element to implement in-place text input and text editing,
  thereby utilising the browser's support for input method editors.
