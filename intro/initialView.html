<h2>Initial and Automatic Viewport Management</h2>
<p>
Once you have created and assigned a model to cause some Parts to appear in your Diagram,
you can control where your parts initially appear in the viewport, and you can control
where they are shown after the diagram has been modified.
</p>

<h3>Initial viewport</h3>
<p>
You can very easily set the <a>Diagram.initialPosition</a> and/or <a>Diagram.initialScale</a> properties
at any time, even before assigning the model.  This will cause the <a>Diagram.position</a> and/or <a>Diagram.scale</a>
properties to be set to the specified initial value(s) once all of the Parts have been created and any initial layout has been performed.
</p>
<p>
But what if you do not know how big your diagram document will be?
If you want to show a particular area of the document, you will not know what position to set.
If you want to show a big document at the largest scale that shows all of it, you will not know what scale to set.
</p>
<p>
One solution to this problem is to set the <a>Diagram.initialContentAlignment</a> or <a>Diagram.initialAutoScale</a> properties.
For example it is fairly common to want to make sure that small documents appear centered within the diagram window --
just set <a>Diagram.initialContentAlignment</a> to <a>Spot.Center</a>.
Or if you want to "zoom-to-fit" the diagram, just set <a>Diagram.initialAutoScale</a> to <a>Diagram.Uniform</a>.
</p>
<p>
More generally, you may want to try to center a particular <a>Node</a>.
Here is how you can do that:
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="centernode">
  diagram.nodeTemplate =
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      new go.Binding("location", "loc"),
      $(go.Shape, { fill: "lightyellow" }),
      $(go.TextBlock, { margin: 5 },
        new go.Binding("text", "loc",
                       function (p) { return p.x.toFixed() + ", " + p.y.toFixed(); }))
    );

  var nodeDataArray = [];
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++ ) {
    nodeDataArray.push({ loc: new go.Point(Math.random() * 600, Math.random() * 300) });
  }

  diagram.model.nodeDataArray = nodeDataArray;

  // this event handler is called when the diagram is first ready
  diagram.addDiagramListener("InitialLayoutCompleted", function(e) {
    // pick a random node data
    var data = nodeDataArray[Math.floor(Math.random()*nodeDataArray.length)];
    // find the corresponding Node
    var node = diagram.findNodeForData(data);
    // and center it and select it
    diagram.centerRect(node.actualBounds);
    diagram.select(node);
  });
</pre>
<script>goCode("centernode", 300, 150)</script>
<p>
Note: because by default one cannot scroll past any edge of the document,
if the selected node happens to be at or near an edge, the node cannot actually be centered in the viewport.
</p>

<h3>Automatic viewport management</h3>
<p>
There are also times when you will want to control the viewport (i.e. the <a>Diagram.position</a> and <a>Diagram.scale</a>)
after every change to the diagram.
For example, if you always want to keep the document centered after the user has moved or deleted or inserted nodes,
set <a>Diagram.contentAlignment</a> (rather than <a>Diagram.initialContentAlignment</a>).
</p>
<p>
Or if you always want to keep the document "zoomed-to-fit", set <a>Diagram.autoScale</a> to <a>Diagram.Uniform</a>.
As an example, the <a>Overview</a> diagram does this.
