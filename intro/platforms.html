<h1>Using GoJS on Different Platforms</h1>
<p>
  GoJS is intended to run in any environment that executes JavaScript. This includes on browsers and within browser frameworks, and also in headless contexts
  such as Node.js.
</p>

<h2>React, Vue, Svelte, Angular</h2>
<p>
  We provide samples and components for common JavaScript UI frameworks. GoJS has no dependencies of its own, and it is our expectation that the library should
  run within any framework. If you are encountering integration issues with an uncommon framework, please
  <a href="https://nwoods.com/contact.html" target="_blank">contact us</a>.
</p>
<p>We maintain examples for common frameworks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>React:</strong> We provide a <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-react" target="_blank">React Component</a> as an
    <a href="https://npmjs.com/gojs-react" target="_blank">NPM package</a> and a usage
    <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-react-basic" target="_blank">sample</a>. See the intro page
    <a href="react.html">Using GoJS with React</a> for more information on React integration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Vue:</strong> We provide a Vue <a href="../samples/vue.html">Vue.js Sample</a>. For a Vue 3 sample, clone the GitHub repository:
    <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-vue-basic">Vue 3 sample using GoJS called <strong>gojs-vue-basic</strong></a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Svelte:</strong> Read the Introduction page about using <a href="svelte.html">Svelte</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Angular:</strong> We provide an <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-angular" target="_blank">Angular Component</a> as an
    <a href="https://npmjs.com/gojs-angular" target="_blank">NPM package</a> and a usage
    <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-angular-basic" target="_blank">sample</a>. See the intro page
    <a href="angular.html">Using GoJS with Angular</a> for more information on Angular integration.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Electron</h2>
<p>
  GoJS can be used in Electron apps. We provide a
  <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS-projects/tree/master/electron-circuit" target="_blank">sample Electron app using GoJS</a>. Note that an
  unlimited domains license is required for use with versions of GoJS before v2.2. As of v2.2, you can specify your Electron app's
  <code>package.json</code> "name" attribute when you request a license key.
</p>

<h2>Blazor</h2>

<p>
  GoJS can be used alongside Blazor, though all code must be written in JavaScript or TypeScript. We have a
  <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS-Alongside-Blazor" target="_blank">sample integrating GoJS into a Blazor project</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There is also the <a href="https://godiagram.com/?fromgojs" target="_blank">GoDiagram library</a>, which is based on the GoJS API, that can be used in C#
  environments. It will work headlessly or as a WinForms control. When headless, this can be used to output static diagram images for Blazor projects, purely in
  C#.
</p>

<h2>Node.js and Headless Environments</h2>
<p>
  GoJS can be used in environments that do not have a DOM. This can be useful for running on a server. We provide a
  <a href="https://gojs.net/latest/intro/nodeScript.html">Node.js script example</a>.
</p>
<p>We also have a Puppeteer example in the <a href="serverSideImages.html">Server-side images intro page</a> for running on a server with a DOM.</p>

<h2>Within iFrames</h2>
<p>
  GoJS can run within iFrames. However, since the library references the global context, such as <code>window</code> on browsers, it is best to invoke GoJS code
  from within the frame it is used.
