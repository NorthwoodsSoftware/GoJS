<h1>Shapes</h1>
<p>
  Use the <a>Shape</a> class to paint a geometrical figure.
  You can control what kind of shape is drawn and how its outline is stroked and how its interior is filled.
</p>
<p>
  Shapes, like <a>TextBlock</a>s and <a>Picture</a>s, are "atomic" objects -- they cannot contain any other objects.
  So a Shape will never draw some text or an image.
</p>
<p>
  In these simplistic demonstrations, the code programmatically creates a Part and adds it to the Diagram.
  Once you learn about models and data binding you will generally not create parts (nodes or links) programmatically.
</p>

<h2 id="Figures">Figures</h2>
<p>
  You can set the <a>Shape.figure</a> property to commonly named kinds of shapes.
  When using the constructor, you can pass the figure name as a string argument.
  You may also need to set the <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> or <a>GraphObject.width</a> and <a>GraphObject.height</a> properties,
  although it is also common to have the size determined by the Panel that the shape is in.
</p>
<p>Here are several of the most often used Shape figures:</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="figureShapes"><code>
const settings = { width: 40, height: 60, margin: 4, fill: null };
diagram.add(
  new go.Part("Horizontal")
    .add(
      new go.Shape("Rectangle",        settings),
      new go.Shape("RoundedRectangle", settings),
      new go.Shape("Capsule",          settings),
      new go.Shape("Ellipse",          settings),
      new go.Shape("Diamond",          settings),
      new go.Shape("TriangleRight",    settings),
      new go.Shape("TriangleDown",     settings),
      new go.Shape("TriangleLeft",     settings),
      new go.Shape("TriangleUp",       settings),
      new go.Shape("MinusLine",        settings),
      new go.Shape("PlusLine",         settings),
      new go.Shape("XLine",            settings)
    ));
</code></pre>
<script>
  goCode('figureShapes', 600, 100);
</script>
<p>
  You can see all of the named geometrical figures in the <a href="../samples/shapes.html" target="samples">shapes</a> sample.
  Some of the most commonly used figures are predefined in the <b>GoJS</b> library.
  But most figures are defined in the <a href="../extensions/Figures.js" target="_blank">Figures.js</a> file in the extensions directory.
</p>

<h2 id="FillAndStrokes">Fill and Strokes</h2>
<p>
  The <a>Shape.stroke</a> property specifies the brush used to draw the shape's outline.
  The <a>Shape.fill</a> property specifies the brush used to fill the shape's outline.
  Additional "stroke..." properties also control how the shape's outline is drawn.
  The most common such property is <a>Shape.strokeWidth</a>.
  It is often set to zero so that no stroke is drawn at all -- only the fill occupying the geometry of the shape.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="strokedShapes"><code>
const settings = { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4 };
diagram.add(
  new go.Part("Horizontal")
    .add(
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ /* default fill and stroke are "black" */ }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ fill: "green" }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ fill: "green", stroke: null }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ fill: null, stroke: "green" }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ fill: null, stroke: "green", strokeWidth: 3 }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ fill: null, stroke: "green", strokeWidth: 6 }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ fill: "green", background: "orange" })
    ));
</code></pre>
<script>
  goCode('strokedShapes', 600, 100);
</script>

<p>
  The <a>Shape.stroke</a> and <a>Shape.fill</a> properties take <a>Brush</a>es but most often are given a CSS color string
  to specify a solid color brush.
  These two properties default to a solid black brush.
  However it is common to assign one of them to be either null or "transparent".
  A null brush means that nothing is drawn for that stroke or fill.
  A transparent brush produces the same appearance but different hit-testing behavior.
  A shape with a null <a>Shape.fill</a> produces a hollow shape -- clicking inside the shape will not hit that shape and
  thus not select the <a>Node</a> that that shape is in.
  But a shape with a "transparent" fill produces a filled shape -- a mouse event inside the shape will hit that shape.
</p>
<p>
  Note that specifying a null or transparent <a>Shape.stroke</a> still means that the size of the shape includes the width of the stroke,
  even though nothing is drawn there.
  If you don't want any stroke at all, it is usually best to set <a>Shape.strokeWidth</a> to zero.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" class="lang-js" id="fill"><code>
diagram.div.style.background = "lightgray";
const settings = { row: 0, figure: "Club", width: 60, height: 60, margin: 4 };
diagram.add(
  new go.Part("Table")
    .add(
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ column: 0, fill: "green" }),
      new go.TextBlock("green", { row: 1, column: 0 }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ column: 1, fill: "white" }),
      new go.TextBlock("white", { row: 1, column: 1 }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ column: 2, fill: "transparent" }),
      new go.TextBlock("transparent", { row: 1, column: 2 }),
      new go.Shape(settings)
        .set({ column: 3, fill: null }),
      new go.TextBlock("null", { row: 1, column: 3 })
    ));
</code></pre>
<script>
  goCode('fill', 600, 100);
</script>
<p>
  Try clicking inside each of the shapes to see which ones will respond to the click and cause the whole panel to be selected.
  Note that with the "transparent" fill you can see the diagram background, yet when you click in it you hit the Shape.
  Only the last one, with a null fill, is truly hollow.
  Clicking in the last shape will only result in a click on the diagram background, unless you click on the stroke outline.
</p>

<h2 id="Geometry">Geometry</h2>
<p>
  Every <a>Shape</a> gets its "shape" from the <a>Geometry</a> that it uses.
  A Geometry is just a saved description of how to draw some lines given a set of points.
  Setting <a>Shape.figure</a> uses a named predefined geometry that can be parameterized.
  In general it is most efficient to give a Shape a Geometry rather than giving it a figure.
</p>
<p>
  If you want something different from all of the predefined figures in <b>GoJS</b>,
  you can construct your own Geometry and set <a>Shape.geometry</a>.
  One way of building your own <a>Geometry</a> is by building <a>PathFigure</a>s consisting of <a>PathSegment</a>s.
  This is often necessary when building a geometry whose points are computed based on some data.
</p>
<p>
  But an easier way to create constant geometries is by calling <a>Geometry.parse</a> to read a string that has a geometry-defining path expression,
  or to set <a>Shape.geometryString</a> to such a string.
  These expressions have commands for moving an imaginary "pen".
  The syntax for geometry paths is documented in the <a href="geometry.html">Geometry Path Strings</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  This example creates a Geometry that looks like the letter "W" and uses it in several Shape objects with different stroke characteristics.
  Geometry objects may be shared by multiple Shapes.
  Note that there may be no need to specify the <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> or <a>GraphObject.width</a> and <a>GraphObject.height</a>,
  because the Geometry defines its own size.
  If the size is set or if it is imposed by the containing Panel, the effective geometry is determined by the <a>Shape.geometryStretch</a> property.
  Depending on the value of the geometryStretch property, this may result in extra empty space or the clipping of the shape.

<p>
  Besides setting the <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> or <a>GraphObject.width</a> and <a>GraphObject.height</a> to declare the size of a <a>Shape</a>, you can
  also set other properties to affect the appearance. For example, you can set the <a>GraphObject.angle</a> and <a>GraphObject.scale</a> properties.

  <a href="textBlocks.html#IconFonts">Icon Fonts</a>
</p>

<h2 id="CustomFigures">Custom Figures</h2>
<p>
  As shown above, one can easily create custom shapes just by setting <a>Shape.geometry</a> or <a>Shape.geometryString</a>. This is particularly convenient when
  importing SVG. However it is also possible to define additional named figures, which is convenient when you want to be able to easily specify or change the
  geometry of an existing Shape by setting or data binding the <a>Shape.figure</a> property.
</p>
<p>
  The static function <a>Shape.defineFigureGenerator</a> can be used to define new figure names. The second argument is a function that is called with the
  <a>Shape</a> and the expected width and height in order to generate and return a <a>Geometry</a>. This permits parameterization of the geometry based on
  properties of the Shape and the expected size. In particular, the <a>Shape.parameter1</a> and <a>Shape.parameter2</a> properties can be considered, in
  addition to the width and height, while producing the Geometry. To be valid, the generated Geometry bounds must be equal to or less than the supplied width
  and height.
</p>

<p>
  Note how the <a>Shape.parameter1</a> property, data bound to the "p1" property, controls how thick the sides are. The <a>Shape.parameter2</a> property, data
  bound to the "p2" property, controls how thick the top and bottom are. You can see the effects by resizing a shape. Notice how it doesn't bother drawing the
  empty area in the middle when there isn't enough width or height.
