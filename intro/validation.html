<h1>Validation</h1>
<p>
Some operations require more sophisticated controls than the binary permission flags discussed in the previous <a href="permissions.html">section</a>.
When the user tries to draw a new link or reconnect an existing link, your application may want to restrict which links may be made,
depending on the data.
When the user tries to add a node to a group, your application may want to control whether it is permitted for that particular
node in that particular group.
When the user edits some text, your application may want to limit the kinds of strings that they enter.
</p>
<p>
Although not exactly "validation", you can also limit how users drag (move or copy) parts by setting several properties on <a>Part</a> and customizing the <a>DraggingTool</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="LinkingValidation">Linking Validation</h2>
<p>
There are a number of <a>GraphObject</a> properties that let you control what links the user may draw or reconnect.
These properties apply to each port element and affect the links that may connect with that port.
</p>

<h3 id="LinkableProperties">Linkable properties</h3>
<p>
The primary properties are <a>GraphObject.fromLinkable</a> and <a>GraphObject.toLinkable</a>.
If you do not have a <a>Node</a> containing an element with fromLinkable: true and another node
with toLinkable: true, the user will not be able to draw a new link between the nodes.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="linkable">
  diagram.nodeTemplate =
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      new go.Binding("location", "loc", go.Point.parse),
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
        { fill: "green", portId: "", cursor: "pointer" },
        new go.Binding("fromLinkable", "from"),
        new go.Binding("toLinkable", "to")),
      $(go.TextBlock,
        { stroke: "white", margin: 3 },
        new go.Binding("text", "key"))
    );

  var nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "From1", loc: "0 0", from: true },
    { key: "From2", loc: "0 100", from: true },
    { key: "To1", loc: "150 0", to: true },
    { key: "To2", loc: "150 100", to: true }
  ];
  var linkDataArray = [
    // initially no links
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, linkDataArray);
</pre>
<script>goCode("linkable", 600, 150)</script>
<p>
Mouse down on the green ellipse (the cursor changes to a "pointer") and drag to start drawing a new link.
Note how the only permitted links are those going from a "From" node to a "To" node.
This is true even if you start the linking gesture on a "To" node.
</p>

<h3 id="SpanOfLinkableProperties">Span of Linkable properties</h3>
<p>
Because the <a>TextBlock</a> in the above example is not declared to be a port (i.e. there is no value for <a>GraphObject.portId</a>),
mouse events on the TextBlock do not start the <a>LinkingTool</a>.
This allows users the ability to select and move the node as well as any number of other operations.
</p>
<p>
You can certainly declare a <a>Panel</a> to have <a>GraphObject.fromLinkable</a> or <a>GraphObject.toLinkable</a> be true.
This will cause all elements inside that panel to behave as part of the port, including starting a linking operation.
Sometimes you will want to make the whole <a>Node</a> linkable.
If you still want the user to be able to select and drag the node, you will need to make some easy-to-click elements not-"linkable" within the node.
You can do that by explicitly setting <a>GraphObject.fromLinkable</a> and/or <a>GraphObject.toLinkable</a> to false.
The default value for those two properties is null, which means the "linkable"-ness is inherited from the containing panel.
</p>

<h2 id="OtherLinkingPermissionProperties">Other linking permission properties</h2>
<p>
Just because you have set <a>GraphObject.fromLinkable</a> and <a>GraphObject.toLinkable</a>
to true on the desired port objects
does not mean that you want to allow users to create a link from every such port/node to every other port/node.
There are other <a>GraphObject</a> properties governing linkability for both the "from" and the "to" ends.
</p>

<h3 id="LinkableDuplicatesProperties">LinkableDuplicates properties</h3>
<p>
One restriction that you may have noticed before is that the user cannot draw a second link between the same pair
of nodes in the same direction.
This example sets <a>GraphObject.fromLinkableDuplicates</a> or <a>GraphObject.toLinkableDuplicates</a> to true,
in order to permit such duplicate links between nodes.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="linkableDuplicates">
  diagram.nodeTemplate =
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      new go.Binding("location", "loc", go.Point.parse),
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
        { fill: "green", portId: "", cursor: "pointer",
          fromLinkableDuplicates: true, toLinkableDuplicates: true },
        new go.Binding("fromLinkable", "from"),
        new go.Binding("toLinkable", "to")),
      $(go.TextBlock,
        { stroke: "white", margin: 3 },
        new go.Binding("text", "key"))
    );

  var nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "From1", loc: "0 0", from: true },
    { key: "From2", loc: "0 100", from: true },
    { key: "To1", loc: "150 0", to: true },
    { key: "To2", loc: "150 100", to: true }
  ];
  var linkDataArray = [
    // initially no links
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, linkDataArray);
</pre>
<script>goCode("linkableDuplicates", 600, 150)</script>
<p>
Now try drawing multiple links between "From1" and "To1".
You can see how the links are automatically spread apart.
Try dragging one of the nodes to see what happens with the link routing.
A similar effect occurs also when the link's <a>Link.curve</a> is <a>Link,Bezier</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="LinkableSelfNodeProperties">LinkableSelfNode properties</h3>
<p>
Another standard restriction is that the user cannot draw a link from a node to itself.
Again it is easy to remove that restriction: just set <a>GraphObject.fromLinkableSelfNode</a>
and <a>GraphObject.toLinkableSelfNode</a> to true.
Note though that each node has to be both <a>GraphObject.fromLinkable</a> and <a>GraphObject.toLinkable</a>.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="linkableSelfNodes">
  diagram.nodeTemplate =
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      new go.Binding("location", "loc", go.Point.parse),
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
        { fill: "green", portId: "", cursor: "pointer",
          fromLinkable: true, toLinkable: true,
          fromLinkableDuplicates: true, toLinkableDuplicates: true,
          fromLinkableSelfNode: true, toLinkableSelfNode: true }),
      $(go.TextBlock,
        { stroke: "white", margin: 3 },
        new go.Binding("text", "key"))
    );

  var nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "Node1", loc: "0 0" },
    { key: "Node2", loc: "150 50" }
  ];
  var linkDataArray = [
    // initially no links
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, linkDataArray);
</pre>
<script>goCode("linkableSelfNodes", 600, 150)</script>
<p>
To draw a reflexive link, start drawing a new link but stay near the node when you release the mouse button.
This example also sets the "Duplicates" properties to true, so that you can draw multiple reflexive links.
</p>

<p>
In these examples there is only one port per node.
When there are multiple ports in a node, the restrictions actually apply per port, not per node.
But the restrictions of the "LinkableSelfNode" properties do span the whole node,
so they must be applied to both ports within a node for a link to connect to its own node.
</p>

<h3 id="MaxLinksProperties">MaxLinks properties</h3>
<p>
The final linking restriction properties control how many links may connect to a node/port.
This example sets the <a>GraphObject.toMaxLinks</a> property to 2,
even though <a>GraphObject.toLinkableDuplicates</a> is true,
to limit how many links may go into "to" nodes.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="linkableMax">
  diagram.nodeTemplate =
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      new go.Binding("location", "loc", go.Point.parse),
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
        { fill: "green", portId: "", cursor: "pointer",
          fromLinkableDuplicates: true, toLinkableDuplicates: true,
          toMaxLinks: 2 },  // at most TWO links can come into this node
        new go.Binding("fromLinkable", "from"),
        new go.Binding("toLinkable", "to")),
      $(go.TextBlock,
        { stroke: "white", margin: 3 },
        new go.Binding("text", "key"))
    );

  var nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "From1", loc: "0 0", from: true },
    { key: "From2", loc: "0 100", from: true },
    { key: "To1", loc: "150 0", to: true },
    { key: "To2", loc: "150 100", to: true }
  ];
  var linkDataArray = [
    // initially no links
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, linkDataArray);
</pre>
<script>goCode("linkableMax", 600, 150)</script>
<p>
This example has no limit on the number of links that may come out of "from" nodes.
</p>
<p>
If this property is set, it is most commonly set to one.
Of course it depends on the nature of the application.
</p>
<p>
Note that the <a>GraphObject.toMaxLinks</a> and <a>GraphObject.fromMaxLinks</a> properties are independent of each other.
If you want to control the total number of links connecting with a port, not only "to" or "from" but both directions,
then you cannot use those two properties and instead must implement your own link validation predicate, as discussed below.
</p>

<h2 id="CyclesInGraphs">Cycles in graphs</h2>
<p>
If you want to make sure that the graph structure that your users create never have any cycles of links,
or that the graph is always tree-structured, <b>GoJS</b> makes that easy to enforce.
Just set <a>Diagram.validCycle</a> to <a>Diagram,CycleNotDirected</a> or <a>Diagram,CycleDestinationTree</a>.
The default value is <a>Diagram,CycleAll</a>, which imposes no restrictions -- all kinds of link cycles are allowed.
</p>
<p>
This example has nodes that allow links both to and from each node.
However the assignment of <a>Diagram.validCycle</a> will prevent the user from drawing
a second incoming link to any node and also ensures that the user draw no cycles in the graph.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="tree">
  diagram.nodeTemplate =
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
        { fill: "green", portId: "", cursor: "pointer",
          fromLinkable: true, toLinkable: true }),
      $(go.TextBlock,
        { stroke: "white", margin: 3 },
        new go.Binding("text", "key"))
    );

  var nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "Node1" }, { key: "Node2" }, { key: "Node3" },
    { key: "Node4" }, { key: "Node5" }, { key: "Node6" },
    { key: "Node7" }, { key: "Node8" }, { key: "Node9" }
  ];
  var linkDataArray = [
    // initially no links
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, linkDataArray);

  // only allow links that maintain tree-structure
  diagram.validCycle = go.Diagram.CycleDestinationTree;
</pre>
<script>goCode("tree", 600, 250)</script>
<p>
As you draw more links you can see how the set of potential linking destinations keeps getting smaller.
</p>

<h2 id="GeneralLinkingValidation">General linking validation</h2>
<p>
It may be the case that the semantics of your application will cause the set of valid link destinations to depend
on the node data (i.e. at the node and port at which the link started from and at the possible destination node/port)
in a manner that can only be implemented using code: a predicate function.
</p>
<p>
You can implement such domain-specific validation by setting <a>LinkingBaseTool.linkValidation</a> or <a>Node.linkValidation</a>.
These predicates, if supplied, are called for each pair of ports that the linking tool considers.
If the predicate returns false, the link may not be made.
Setting the property on the <a>LinkingTool</a> or <a>RelinkingTool</a>causes the predicate to be applied to all linking operations,
whereas setting the property on the <a>Node</a> only applies to linking operations involving that node.
The predicates are called only if all of the standard link checks pass, based on the properties discussed above.
</p>
<p>
In this example there are nodes of three different colors.
The <a>LinkingTool</a> and <a>RelinkingTool</a> are customized to use a function, <code>sameColor</code>,
to make sure the links only connect nodes of the same color.
Mouse-down and drag on the ellipses (where the cursor changes to a "pointer") to start drawing a new link.
You will see that the only permitted link destinations are nodes of the same color that do not already have a link to it from the same node.
</p>

<p>
To emphasize the color restriction, links have their colors bound to the "from" node data.
</p>

<h3 id="Limitingtotalnumberoflinksconnectingwithanode">Limiting total number of links connecting with a node</h3>
<p>
  One can limit the number of links coming into a port by setting <a>GraphObject.toMaxLinks</a>.
  Similarly, one can limit the number of links coming out of a port by setting <a>GraphObject.fromMaxLinks</a>.
  But what if you want to limit the total number of links connecting with a port regardless of whether they are coming into or going out of a port?
  Such constraints can only be implemented by a link validation predicate.
</p>
<p>
  When wanting to limit the total number of links in either direction, connecting with each port, one can use this <a>Node.linkValidation</a> predicate:
</p>
<pre class="lang-js">
  $(go.Node, . . .,
    {
      linkValidation: function(fromnode, fromport, tonode, toport) {
        // total number of links connecting with a port is limited to 1:
        return fromnode.findLinksConnected(fromport.portId).count +
               tonode.findLinksConnected(toport.portId).count < 1;
      }
    }, . . .
</pre>
<p>
  When wanting to limit the total number of links in either direction, connecting with a node for all of its ports, one can use this <a>Node.linkValidation</a> predicate:
</p>
<pre class="lang-js">
  $(go.Node, . . .,
    {
      linkValidation: function(fromnode, fromport, tonode, toport) {
        // total number of links connecting with all ports of a node is limited to 1:
        return fromnode.linksConnected.count + tonode.linksConnected.count < 1;
      }
    }, . . .
</pre>

<h2 id="GroupingValidation">Grouping validation</h2>
<p>
When you want to limit the kinds of nodes that the user may add to a particular group,
you can implement a predicate as the <a>CommandHandler.memberValidation</a> or <a>Group.memberValidation</a> property.
Setting the property on the <a>CommandHandler</a> causes the predicate to be applied to all Groups,
whereas setting the property on the <a>Group</a> only applies to that group.
</p>
<p>
In this example the <code>samePrefix</code> predicate is used to determine if a Node
may be dropped into a Group.
Try dragging the simple textual nodes on the left side into either of the groups on the right side.
Only when dropping the node onto a group that is highlit "green" will the node be added as a member of the group.
You can verify that by moving the group to see if the textual node moves too.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="grouping">
  // this predicate is true if both node data keys start with the same letter
  function samePrefix(group, node) {
    if (group === null) return true;  // when maybe dropping a node in the background
    if (node instanceof go.Group) return false;  // don't add Groups to Groups
    return group.data.key.charAt(0) === node.data.key.charAt(0);
  };

        // support highlighting of Groups when allowing a drop to add a member

    { key: "A2", loc: "10 60" },
    { key: "B1", loc: "10 90" },  // can be added to "B" group
    { key: "B2", loc: "10 120" },
    { key: "C1", loc: "10 150" }  // cannot be added to either group
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, []);
</pre>
<script>goCode("grouping", 600, 300)</script>
<p>
These groups are fixed size groups -- they do not use <a>Placeholder</a>s.
So when a node is dropped into them the group does not automatically resize itself to surround its member nodes.
But that is also a benefit when dragging a node out of a group.
</p>
<p>
The validation predicate is also called when dragging a node that is already a member of a group.
You can see how it is acceptable to drop the node into its existing containing group.
And when it is dragged outside of the group into the diagram's background, the predicate is called with null as the "group" argument.
</p>
<p>
In this example it is always OK to drop a node in the background of the diagram rather than into a group.
If you want to disallow dropping in the background, you can call <code>myDiagram.currentTool.doCancel()</code>
in the <a>Diagram.mouseDrop</a> event handler.
If you want to show feedback during the drag in the background, you can implement a <a>Diagram.mouseDragOver</a> event handler that sets
<code>myDiagram.currentCursor = "not-allowed"</code>.
This would be behavior similar to that implemented above when dragging inside a Group.
</p>


<h2 id="TextEditingValidation">Text editing validation</h2>
<p>
You can also limit what text the user enters when they do in-place text editing of a <a>TextBlock</a>.
First, to enable any editing at all, you will need to set <a>TextBlock.editable</a> to true.
There may be many TextBlocks within a Part, but you might want to limit text editing to particular TextBlocks.
</p>
<p>
Normally there is no limitation on what text the user may enter.
If you want to provide a predicate to approve the input when the user finishes editing,
set the <a>TextEditingTool.textValidation</a> or <a>TextBlock.textValidation</a> property.
Setting the property on the <a>TextEditingTool</a> causes the predicate to be applied to all TextBlocks,
whereas setting the property on the <a>TextBlock</a> only applies to that text object.
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="textEditing">
  // this predicate is true if the new string has at least three characters
  // and has a vowel in it

<p>
  Note how editing the top TextBlock accepts text without any vowels,
  but the bottom one does not accept it and instead leaves the text editor open.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to execute code after a text edit completes, implement a "TextEdited"
  <a>DiagramEvent</a> listener.

<h3 id="ShowingTextEditingErrorMessage">Showing a Text Editing Error Message</h3>
<p>
If you would like to show a custom error message when text validation fails,
one way is to show a tooltip <a>Adornment</a>.
Here is an example where a valid string must contain the letter "W".
</p>
<pre class="lang-js" id="textEditingMessage">
diagram.nodeTemplate =
  $(go.Node, "Auto",
    $(go.Shape,
      { fill: "white", portId: "", fromLinkable: true, toLinkable: true, cursor: "pointer" },
      new go.Binding("fill", "color")),
    $(go.TextBlock,

        margin: 8,
        editable: true,
        isMultiline: false,
        textValidation: function(tb, olds, news) {

        },
        errorFunction: function(tool, olds, news) {
          // create and show tooltip about why editing failed for this textblock
          var mgr = tool.diagram.toolManager;
          mgr.hideToolTip();  // hide any currently showing tooltip
          var node = tool.textBlock.part;

          mgr.hideToolTip();
        }
      },
      new go.Binding("text").makeTwoWay())
  );

diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel([
  { key: 1, text: "Alpha" },
  { key: 2, text: "Beta" }
], [
  { from: 1, to: 2 }
]);
</pre>
<script>goCode("textEditingMessage", 600, 200)</script>
<p>
  Try editing the text of a node by twice clicking on some text.
  If the string does not have the letter "W" in it, it will show an error message describing the problem.
