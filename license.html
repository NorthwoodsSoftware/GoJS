      <h2 class="my-4 text-3xl">Software License Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        This Software License Agreement (“this Agreement”) is a legal agreement between
        Northwoods Software Corporation, a New Hampshire corporation (“Northwoods”), and
        the individual or the firm, company, or other organization identified as the
        licensee (“Customer” or “You”) in the license certificate issued by Northwoods for
        this Agreement (the “License Certificate”). The terms of the License Certificate
        are an integral part of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The licensed software, consisting of libraries, executables, documentation, and
        samples created by Northwoods (collectively “Software”), is identified in the
        License Certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
        BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
        AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN
        YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.
      </p>
      <h2>1 OWNERSHIP</h2>
      <p>
        The Software is licensed, not sold. Northwoods retains all right, title, and
        interest in and to the Software, including all trade secrets and intellectual
        property rights. This Agreement does not grant Customer any rights to patents,
        trademarks, or copyrights except as expressly set forth herein.
      </p>
      <h2>2 GRANT OF LICENSE</h2>
      <h3>2.1 License</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Northwoods hereby grants
        Customer a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (“License”) to use
        the Software. The License permits such number of developers in the Customer’s
        designated licensed group (each as specified in the License Certificate) to use
        the Software to develop such number of applications (each, an “Application”) as is
        specified in the License Certificate – which, unless a greater number of
        Applications is expressly stated in the License Certificate, is limited to one (1)
        Application.
      </p>
      <p>Customer may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          copy the Software or any portion thereof, but only for purposes of Customer’s
          use thereof as permitted by this Agreement;
        </li>
        <li>use the API of the Software to develop an Application; and</li>
        <li>modify and incorporate any of the samples into an Application.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.2 Restrictions</h3>
      <p>Customer shall not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>modify the libraries or executables in the Software;</li>
        <li>
          create derivative works of the Software or any portion thereof, other than an
          Application;
        </li>
        <li>
          reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or deobfuscate the Software except to
          the extent permitted by applicable law;
        </li>
        <li>
          distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise provide the Software or any portion
          thereof to any third party, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this
          Agreement; or
        </li>
        <li>remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices in the Software.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.3 Source Code</h3>
      <p>
        If the License Certificate specifies that You have source code rights, You may use
        and modify the source code form of the Software (“Source Code”).
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that the Source Code is proprietary to Northwoods. You
        shall:

      <ul>
        <li>maintain the Source Code in confidence;</li>
        <li>
          not disclose, distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise provide the Source Code
          to any third party;
        </li>
        <li>only include minified or compiled Source Code in any Application;</li>
        <li>
          defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Northwoods and its affiliates, and each of
          their respective officers, directors, employees and representatives from and
          against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, judgements, costs, and
          expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to
          any third party claim with respect to any Source Code modifications made by You.
        </li>
      </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          automatically if Customer breaches this Agreement; provided, that, if such

          Customer within thirty (30) days following the first occurrence of such breach;
        </li>
        <li>
          by Northwoods if Customer becomes insolvent, files for (or has filed against it)

        </li>
        <li>
          by Northwoods or Customer as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3.3 Effect of Termination and Survival</h3>
      <p>
        Upon termination of this Agreement, the License shall automatically end, Customer
        shall promptly cease all use of the Software, and Customer shall certify in
        writing to Northwoods that Customer has complied with its obligations hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following provisions shall survive the termination of this Agreement: Section

      <p>
        Northwoods warrants (the “Limited Warranty”) that the Software will, for a period
        of thirty (30) days following the Effective Date (the “Limited Warranty Period”),
        function substantially as set forth in related Software documentation. In the
        event of a breach of the Limited Warranty, Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy
        for such breach shall be repair or replacement of the defective Software within
        thirty (30) days of being notified of such breach, or, if Northwoods is unable to
        repair or replace the defective Software, or determines that such repair or
        replacement is impractical in Northwoods' sole judgment, then Northwoods may
        terminate this Agreement by providing written notice thereof to Customer and shall
        refund fees paid by Customer to Northwoods in the previous thirty (30) day period.
      </p>
