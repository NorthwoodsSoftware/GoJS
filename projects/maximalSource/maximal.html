  <!-- The DIV for the Diagram needs an explicit size or else we won't see anything.

  <p>
    This sample uses a JavaScript file that is built with Webpack. If you do not see a diagram, you may need to build first. See the <a href="./readme.md">readme.md in this directory</a> for details.
  </p>

  <p>
    This maximal sample builds from source with all GoJS modules.
    As a result, the build JavaScript is large, but all functionality is present.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="./maximal-index.ts">maximal-index.ts</a> displays how to include every GoJS module into a build.
  </p>

  <p>
    For an example of building GoJS from source with as few modules as possible,
    see the <a href="../minimalSource/minimal.html">Minimal project</a> adjacent to this directory.
