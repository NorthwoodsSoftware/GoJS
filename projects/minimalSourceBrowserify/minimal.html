  <!-- The DIV for the Diagram needs an explicit size or else we won't see anything.
       This also adds a border to help see the edges of the viewport. -->
  <div id="myDiagramDiv" style="border: solid 1px black; width:400px; height:400px"></div>

  <p>
    This sample uses a JavaScript file that is built with Browserify. If you do not see a diagram, you may need to build first.
    See the <a href="./readme.md">readme.md in this directory</a> for details.
  </p>

  <p>
    This minimal sample contains as few GoJS modules as possible when building from the source.
    As a result, there is almost no interactivity possible, as no tools or the CommandHandler exist.
    There are also no Layouts (except the base Layout), Overviews, or Palettes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you look at the <a href="./minimal-index.ts">minimal-index.ts</a> you will see what is dis-included.
  </p>

  <p>
    For an example of building GoJS from source with all modules, see the <a href="../maximalSource/maximal.html">Maximal project</a> adjacent to this directory.
