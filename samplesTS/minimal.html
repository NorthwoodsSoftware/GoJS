    This isn't a truly <i>minimal</i> demonstration of <b>GoJS</b>,
    because we do specify a custom Node template, but it's pretty simple.
    The whole source for the sample is shown below if you click on the link.

  <p>
    This sample sets the <a>Diagram.nodeTemplate</a>, with a <a>Node</a> template that data binds both the text string and the shape's fill color.
    For an overview of building your own templates and model data, see the <a href="../learn/index.html">Getting Started tutorial.</a>

    Using the mouse and common keyboard commands, you can pan, select, move, copy, delete, and undo/redo.
    On touch devices, use your finger to act as the mouse, and hold your finger stationary to bring up a context menu.
    The default context menu supports most of the standard commands that
    are enabled at that time for the selected object.
